            <h2>Why Skiing</h2>
            <h3>Skiing, the sport that makes winter fun</h3>
            <p>
              Skiing has a history of almost five millennia. Although modern
              skiing has evolved from beginnings in Scandinavia, it may have
              been practiced more than 100 centuries ago in what is now China,
              according to an interpretation of ancient paintings.
            </p>
            <p>
              Skiing was primarily used for transport until the mid-19th century
              but, since then, it has also become a recreation and sport.
              Military ski races were held in Norway during the 18th century,
              and ski warfare was studied in the late 18th century. As equipment
              evolved and ski lifts were developed during the late 19th and
              early 20th centuries, two main genres of skiing emergedâ€”Alpine
              (downhill) skiing and Nordic skiing. The main difference between
              the two is the type of ski binding (the way in which the ski boots
              are attached to the skis).
